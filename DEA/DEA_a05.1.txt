ED_Spider_Glasher - A hybrid of the Guard and Slasher, best of both worlds. Includes ice and radiation biome variants.
ED_Spider_Spitter_Cyan - A web spitter variant which applies the stalker shield disruption effect
ED_Spider_Spitter_Pink - A web spitter variant which applies a marked-for-death status effect
ED_Spider_Spitter_Stagger - A web spitter variant which applies the slasher stun effect
ED_Spider_Spitter_White - A web spitter variant which does not apply any status effect
ED_Spider_Shooter_Spawner - A ground acid spitter which lobs dreadnaught swarmer eggs which spawn 2*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot
ED_Spider_Slobber - A septic spreader variant which lobs deadnaught swarmer eggs which spawn 2*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot
ED_Spider_Shooter_Ice - An acid spitter variant which applies cold damage on hit, rather than the acid STE
ED_Spider_Shooter_Fire - an acid spitter variant which fires OG dread fireball, slightly less aggressive behavior
ED_Spider_Shooter_Bouncer - A ground acid spitter which lobs RJ250 at you. Should do half the damage of a typical spitter prj, within 2m max damage radius
ED_Mactera_Trundle - A hybrid of the tri-jaw and brundle. I suggest using CD2 to change its materials if you use it
ED_Spider_Grooter - A grunt/acid lobber hybrid which will lob ground acid spitter PRJs in a tri jaw like pattern. Mostly a proof of concept hybrid ranged/melee enemy
ED_Spider_Grooter_Wall - hybrid melee/range grunt with wall pathfinding preference, same triple acid lob attack as grooter
ED_Spider_Grooter_Ceiling - grooter with ceiling pathfinding preference, and normal acid spitter attack
ED_Spider_Gritter_Wall - lower health than grooter, with web spitter attack instead of acid
ED_Spider_Gritter_Ceiling - ceiling pathfinding preference 

ED_Spider_Fanatic - A menace variant which uses the arbalest fireball fan attack, rather than normal menace attack. Long delay between attacks, and fires 5 times before reburrowing. 
ED_Spider_ShotgunMenace - Similar to the Fanatic, but fires 9 fireballs in a grid pattern, rather than 5 in a fan

ED_Mactera_Pentajaw - tri = 3, penta = 5
ED_StabberVine - these are spawning... weirdly but they do spawn on horizontal surfaces and rotate correctly at least
ED_Bomber_NoShot - Goo bomber with no projectile attack

ED_Parabomber - drops spawn eggs and fires an egg which applies phero STE. greatly reduced drop rate compared to typical goober and each spawn egg spawns 1*enemy  count modifier of ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot
ED_Enola_Gay - guess
ED_Arbabomber - firebomber with projectile attack replaced with arbalest mines, no visual difference from firebomber
ED_Bomber_Exploder - firebomber whose projectile attack spawns exploders, no visual difference from firebomber. spawned exploders use ED_Spider_Exploder_SpawnShot 

ED_Spider_SlobberEX - spawns 6*enemy count modifier
ED_Spider_Shooter_SpawnerEX - spawns 6*enemy count modifier
ED_ShootingPlant_Spawner - fires spawn egg which spawns 6*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot
ED_ShootingPlant_SpawnerEX - also applies phero STE
ED_ShootingPlant_Spawner_Boomer - fires spawn egg which spawns 6*enemy count modifier of ED_Spider_Exploder_SpawnShot

ED_Spider_FanaticEX - original pre nerf version of Fanatic, with normal menace AI
ED_Spider_ShotgunMenaceEX - ditto
ED_Fauxnought - non health gated dreadnought, slightly smaller than normal dread. Has slightly above Oppressor health and Large enemy health scaling. eggshot spawns ED_Spider_Swarmer_SpawnShot

Twins: do not reccomend allowing these to exist at the same time as vanilla twins. will lead to weird behavior of vanilla twin. These will not heal with vanilla twins or each other, but vanilla twins will try to heal with them and will grieve them
ED_Fauxbalester - Arbalester that will use both attacks
ED_Fauxbalester_Locked - Arbalester that will only use mines. technically behaves as a post heal Arbalest, but just uses mines in place of fan attack.
ED_Lassie_Unlocked - A Lacerator that will use burrow attack. 
ED_Lassie_Locked - A Lacerator that will not use burrow attack. Seems to really like its flamethrower attack, probably needs some tweaking. 
ED_Banshee - Arbalest variant that will only use grieve attack


jpeg enemies implemented
ED_Drone_Breeder - breeder which drops homing drones instead of egg
ED_Mactera_Shooter_Breach and ED_Mactera_Brendle - fire modified, faster version of OMEN linecutter
ED_Mactera_RadialJaw - radialjaw

includes a few EDs which don't currently work properly, or don't have a reason to exist
ED_Parasite - originally intended as a base enemy for one of the enemy shooting enemies. same as ED_InfestationLarva. I guess it allows you to use parasites as an enemy while also replacing the enemy spawned by Parasites modifier. If that is something anybody wanted
ED_Sprout_Versatile - attempt to create korlok sprout that could spawn on floor, ceiling, or wall to avoid having to use both floor and ceiling variant in diffs. seems to prefer the floor strongly from limited testing
ED_Woodlouse_Shooter - rolling animation is broken
ED_Woodlouse_Youngling_Bounce - rolling animation is broken
ED_Fauxbalester_Unused - attempt to create an Arbalest that won't heal by using the septic spreader AI. doesn't seem to work very well from my tests
ED_Vegbalester  - another attempt to create non healing arbalest.
